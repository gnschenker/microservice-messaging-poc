= Running a Sample Setup using the standard RabbitMQ Client Library

This is the least elaborate sample as it does not involve any custom types for messages but only uses simple strings. Serialization and deserialization still need to be explicitly added. The other two examples (EasyNetQ and Apache Kafka) provide the same out of the box.

. Navigate into folder `rabbitmq`
+
[source]
--
cd rabbitmq
--

. Build and run the application:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose up --build
--

. Stop the app with `CTRL-c`

. Remove the application with
+
[source]
--
docker-compose down -v
--

== Scaling the consumer

. Run the application:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose up -d
--

. Scale the consumer:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose up -d --scale consumer=3
--

. Follow the logs:
un the application:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose logs -f
--
+
stop following the logs with `CTRL-c`

. Remove the application with
+
[source]
--
docker-compose down -v
--
